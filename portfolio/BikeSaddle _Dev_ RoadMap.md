This is my university research on product development using new technologies applied in Industry 4.0. I showed we could leverage digital transformation in bike saddle development throughout a road map to reach a customized and comfortable product.

The mentioned road map is shown below:

As you can see, we can have benefited from user-generated comments on different platforms such as online shopping websites (suppose Amazon). I used NLP (Lexical Analysis) to mine the data from users' comments for a specific bike saddle. You can see the algorithms in this image:

I derived the main saddle features, which are commented more about. Then using polarity analysis, I understood saddle shell has the lowest polarity. It means customers are not so happy about it. Reviewing some customer's comments showed us they are talking about saddle comfortability. The polarity analysis for bike saddle features is determined below:

The whole process is pictured here:
